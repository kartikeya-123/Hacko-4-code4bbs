# College Management Portal 



Ever felt it would be handier to have all the activities of the institute in one place? 

Well, this website portal has got your back! From lodging complaints about mess food, civil and hygiene in the hostel which will directly be addressed by the hostel office, to obtain materials for your courses, mess menu, dates of every fest and event happening in the institute, you can find everything pertaining to your campus life.

This portal is built by our team **Code4BBS**  during [Hackowasp 3.0](https://hackowasp.live/), the annual Hackathon organized by OWASP Thapar Student Chapter, TIET, Patiala.

**Problem Statement**

Nowadays, the sole requirement of every job is to reduce man labor with exquisite technology. Since the second wave of Covid-19 is resurfacing, we need to think twice before interacting with someone. The colleges have been shut down but we need to be ready with an alternative for the management and administration for the required tasks.

Task:
Build a suitable project to supervise the tasks in offline or online semester, say, from to hostel management to laundry management, from online exams to online teaching. Explore the possibilities and develop to eradicate the problems in the education spectrum.


**The team stood in the top 10 among 100 teams.**

<h3>Features</h3>

The portal uses Google OAuth to allow only the students with the college domain. This is to ensure preventing spamming on the server.

Getting the right people to collaborate at the right time is often tough, more so when the semester goes on virtually. 
This is our attempt to provide a directory of our students which supports search based on skills, positions of responsibilities, student activities, and, of course, branch and year. 

Students will be provided with a timetable based on their course and batch. The portal also provides the opportunities to share resources like previous year question papers, reference guides, etc which will be a great help for the upcoming batches. Also, a daily calendar is present which lists all the important events happening on that particular day.

Students face a lot of issue with hostel facilities and they lack a proper platform to raise their issues so to solve that issue we have a created a platform to raise issues which will be visible to all the students and hostel warden. Students who face similar problems can upvote the issue to increase its impact. Another cool feature is due to very limited sports equipment in the hostel, we created a platform where students can issue particular equipment and also return it.
